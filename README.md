This is a small fabric client mod that allows you to see other players from further away on servers.
It does this by getting the position data from [Dynmap](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap) running on the server and displaying it with waypoints in [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [Worldmap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map).

The mod is originally based on [RemotePlayers](https://github.com/ewpratten/remoteplayers) from ewpratten.

### Features
- see player positions on Xaeros Minimap and Worldmap
- AFK display in tab list
- configurable trough Modmenu and cloth config
- and probably more in the future...

### Important Notes
If you have Xaeros Worlmap installed, make sure to set it to render all waypoint sets. This setting can be found in the waypoint menu.

_This mod is not officially affiliated with Dynmap or Xaero in any way._
