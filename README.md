This is a small fabric client mod that allows you to see other players from further away on servers.
It does this by getting the position data from Dynmap, Bluemap and other online maps running on the server and displaying it with waypoints in [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [Worldmap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map).

### Features
- see player positions on Xaeros Minimap and Worldmap
- AFK display in tab list
- configurable trough Modmenu and cloth config
- and probably more in the future...

### Supported Maps
- Dynmap
- Squaremap
- Bluemap
- ...more planned

### How to use
You just have to add the server you want to use this mod on to the list in the config:<br>
"ip" is the serverip you use to connect to the server<br>
"link" is the weblink to the Map online <br>
And Make sure to set the "map-type" correctly!

The mod is originally based on [RemotePlayers](https://github.com/ewpratten/remoteplayers) from ewpratten.

_This mod is not officially affiliated with Dynmap, Squaremap, Bluemap or Xaero in any way._
