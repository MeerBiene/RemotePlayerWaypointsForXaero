# Remote player waypoints for Xaero's Map

<a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/remote-player-waypoints-for-xaeros-map"><img src="https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/remote-player-waypoints-for-xaeros-map?logo=modrinth&label=&suffix=%20&style=flat&color=242629&labelColor=5ca424&logoColor=1c1c1c" alt="Modrinth"></a>

This is a small fabric client mod that allows you to see other players from further away on servers.
It does this by getting the position data from Dynmap and other online maps running on the server and displaying it with waypoints in [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [Worldmap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map).

The mod is originally based on [RemotePlayers](https://github.com/ewpratten/remoteplayers) from ewpratten.

### Features
- see player positions on Xaeros Minimap and Worldmap
- (currently only data from Dynmap)
- AFK display in tab list
- configurable trough Modmenu and cloth config
- and probably more in the future...

### How to use
You just have to add the server you want to use this mod on to the list in the config:<br>
"ip" is the serverip you use to connect to the server<br>
"link" is the weblink to the Dynmap online (or other maps in the future)

### Important Notes
Make sure to set the Xaero settings to render all waypoint sets. This setting can be found in the waypoint menu or the config.

_This mod is not officially affiliated with Dynmap or Xaero in any way._
